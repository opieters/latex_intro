# LaTeX Intro Workshop

Introduction to LaTeX for writing papers in LaTeX.

Slides (as source `.tex` and final version) are included in the main folder.

## Building

Slides can be compiled with a recent version of TeXLive. The Fira Sans fonts
need to be installed on your system.

## Examples

Examples include both code snippets and the final version of the first 
presentation at ILVO on 2020/09/28 (`final-version.tex`). They can be compiled
with a recent TeXLive version (2019) and `pdflatex`
