  abstract = {In order to estimate vegetation photosynthesis from remote sensing observations; some critical parameters need to be quantified. From all absorbed light; the plant needs to release any excess that is not used for photosynthesis; by non-photochemical quenching; by fluorescence emission and unregulated thermal dissipation. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) processes are controlled photoprotective mechanisms which; once activated; strongly control the dynamics of photochemical efficiency. With illumination conditions increasing and decreasing during a diurnal cycle; photoprotection mechanisms needs to change accordingly. The goal of this work is to quantify dynamic NPQ; measured from active fluorescence measurements; based on passive proximal sensing leaf measurements. During a 22-day controlled light and water stress experiment on a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaf we measured the diurnal dynamics of passive fluorescence (Chl F); the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI); the Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR) and leaf temperature in combination with the actively retrieved non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) parameter. Based on a bi-linear combination of diurnal APAR and PRI (plane fit model) we succeeded to estimate NPQ with a RMSE of 0.08. The simple plane fit model estimation represents well the diurnal NPQ dynamics; except for the high light stress phase; when additional reversible photoinhibition processes took place. The present works presents a way of determining NPQ from passive remote sensing measurements; as a necessary step towards estimating photosynthetic rate.},

  abstract = {Currently, climate change is threatening farming opportunities to feed a growing population, making necessary the implementation of worldwide cultivable lands, also through the improvement of highly intensified cropping systems such as greenhouses and indoor growing modules. To ameliorate plant performance and reach the potential yield in controlled environment, these systems should be based on the fine control of all microclimatic factors among which vapour pressure deficit (VPD) plays a major role. VPD represents a driver for transpiration in plants, and it is crucial in inducing specific plant structure and physiological behaviour. VPD changes with relative air humidity and temperature, and through its control it is possible to regulate the entire evaporative demand of an indoor cultivation. Therefore, VPD control becomes critical to improve plant growth and productivity. The regulation of VPD in controlled environment should be managed dynamically because VPD can modulate morphophysiological processes in plants, which adapt to the new environmental conditions and in turn, modify the environment itself, thus requiring the continuous update of VPD according to phenological phases. The aim of this review is to report VPD effects on plant growth and physiological processes as carbon metabolism and water use efficiency in controlled environments. Available information about the wide variety of VPD effects on different plant traits and species is summarised, considering the structure-mediated regulation of water fluxes in plant. Towards the goal of optimising cultivation strategies in protected agriculture, the importance of considering possible interaction between VPD and other microclimatic factors is highlighted. Finally, future research areas, which should be explored further, based on needed synergies among different expertise from biological and horticultural fields, are identified and discussed.},

Although fluorescence parameters can be measured easily, many potential problems may arise when they are applied to predict changes in photosynthetic performance. In particular, consideration is given to problems associated with accurate estimation of the PSII operating efficiency measured by fluorescence and its relationship with the rates of linear electron flux and CO2 assimilation. The roles of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching in the determination of changes in PSII operating efficiency are examined. Finally, applications of fluorescence imaging to studies of photosynthetic heterogeneity and the rapid screening of large numbers of plants for perturbations in photosynthesis and associated metabolism are considered.},

The implementation of modern RS technology on SIF is highly motivated by the direct link of SIF to the core of photosynthetic machinery. In the last few decades, a lot of studies have been conducted on SIF measurement techniques, retrieval algorithms, modeling, application, validation, and radiative transfer processes, incorporating different RS observations (i.e., ground, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), airborne, and spaceborne). These studies have made a significant contribution to the enrichment of SIF science over time. However, to realize the potential of SIF and to explore its full spectrum using different RS observations, a complete document of existing SIF studies is needed. Considering this gap, we have performed a detailed review of current SIF studies from the ground, UAV, airborne, and spaceborne observations. In this review, we have discussed the in-depth interpretation of each SIF study using four RS platforms. The limitations and challenges of SIF studies have also been discussed to motivate future research and subsequently overcome them. This detailed review of SIF studies will help, support, and inspire the researchers and application-based users to consider SIF science with confidence.},

  abstract = {Early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant, but hard to achieve. We hypothesize that close range hyperspectral imaging is able to uncover stress related processes non-destructively in the early stages which are invisible to the human eye. We propose an approach which combines unsupervised and supervised methods in order to identify several stages of progressive stress development from series of hyperspectral images. Stress of an entire plant is detected by stress response levels at pixel scale. The focus is on drought stress in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Unsupervised learning is used to separate hyperspectral signatures into clusters related to different stages of stress response and progressive senescence. Whereas all such signatures may be found in both, well watered and drought stressed plants, their respective distributions differ. Ordinal classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to quantify and visualize the distribution of progressive stages of senescence and to separate well watered from drought stressed plants. For each senescence stage a distinctive set of most relevant Vegetation Indices (VIs) is identified. The method has been applied on two experiments involving potted barley plants under well watered and drought stress conditions in a greenhouse. Drought stress is detected up to ten days earlier than using NDVI. Furthermore, it is shown that some VIs have overall relevance, while others are specific to particular senescence stages. The transferability of the method to the field is illustrated by an experiment on maize (Zea mays).},

  abstract = {The behaviour of PVC and PVC plastisols has been studied during their thermal treatment using an in situ FTIR technique. The plasticizer introduces certain modifications in the spectrum of the resin which are more marked in the case of the more compatible plasticizers. The A1427A1435 and A637A616 ratios of the intensities of the crystalline and amorphous bands of the resins, decrease in the plastisols when increasing the compatibility of the plasticizer. On the other hand, when the plastisol undergoes the gelation process, a great decrease of these ratios is observed, showing that the increase in temperature produces a decrease in the amount of the crystalline phase in the resin with respect to the amorphous phase. This behaviour has also been observed when the resin is heated without plasticizer, and is a reversible process. The CO band corresponding to the plasticizer shows a different behaviour to the resin bands. When the temperature increases, a shift to lower wavenumbers is observed. This displacement is irreversible (the band does not recover its original location after cooling) and the process occurs in a relative narrow temperature interval. This temperature range, where the carbonyl band suffers these changes, is in good agreement with the gelation temperature as measured by other techniques.},

Hyperspectral methods have the potential to advance high throughput phenotyping efforts by providing a rapid, accurate and non-destructive alternative for estimating biochemical and physiological plant traits. Our study (i) acquired hyperspectral images of wheat plants using a high throughput phenotyping system, (ii) developed regression models capable of predicting water and nitrogen levels of wheat plants and (iii) applied the regression coefficients from the best-performing models to hyperspectral images in order to develop prediction maps to visualise nitrogen and water distribution within plants. Hyperspectral images were collected of four wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes grown in nine soil nutrient conditions and under two water treatments. Five multivariate regression methods in combination with ten spectral pre-processing techniques were employed to find a model with strong predictive performance. Visible and near infrared wavelengths (VNIR: 400-1000nm) alone were not sufficient to accurately predict water and nitrogen content (validation R2=0.56 and R2=0.59 respectively) but model accuracy was improved when shortwave-infrared wavelengths (SWIR: 1000-2500nm) were incorporated (validation R2=0.63 and R2=0.66 respectively). Wavelength reduction produced equivalent model accuracies while reducing model size and complexity (validation R2=0.69 and R2=0.66 for water and nitrogen respectively). Developed distribution maps provided a visual representation of the concentration and distribution of water within plants whilst nitrogen maps seemed to suffer from noise. The findings and methods from this study demonstrate the high potential of high-throughput hyperspectral imagery for estimating and visualising the distribution of plant chemical properties.},

  abstract = {Elevated partial pressures of atmospheric carbon dioxide, similar to numerous causes of plant stress, may alter leaf pigmentation and structure and thus would be expected to alter leaf optical properties. Hypotheses that elevated CO2 pressure and air temperature would alter leaf optical properties were tested for sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in the middle of its fourth growing season under treatment. The saplings had been growing since 1994 in open-top chambers and partial shade at Oak Ridge, Tennessee under the following treatments: (1) ambient CO2 pressure and air temperature (control); (2) CO2 pressure approximately 30 Pa above ambient; (3) air temperatures 3\textdegree C above ambient; and (4) elevated CO2 and air temperature. Under elevated CO2 or temperature, spectral reflectance, transmittance and absorptance in the visible spectrum (400\textendash 720 nm) tended to change in patterns that generally are associated with chlorosis, with maximum differences from the control near 700 nm. However, these changes were not significant at P=0.05. Although reflectance, transmittance and absorptance at 700 nm correlated strongly with leaf chlorophyll concentration, variability in chlorophyll concentration was greater within than among treatments. The lack of treatment effects on pigmentation explained the non-significant change in optical properties in the visible spectrum. Optical properties in the near-infrared (721\textendash 850 nm) were similarly unresponsive to treatment with the exception of an increased absorptance throughout the 739\textendash 850 nm range in leaves that developed under elevated air temperature alone. This response might have resulted from effects of air temperature on leaf internal structure.},

  abstract = {Assessment of disease incidence and severity at farm scale or in agronomic trials is frequently performed based on visual crop inspection, which is a labor intensive task prone to errors associated with its subjectivity. Therefore, alternative methods to relate disease incidence and severity with changes in crop traits are of great interest. Optical imagery in the visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) can potentially be used to detect changes in crop traits caused by pathogen development. Also, cameras on-board of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have flexible data collection capabilities allowing adjustments considering the trade-off between data throughput and its resolution. However, studies focusing on the use of UAV imagery to describe changes in crop traits related to disease infection are still lacking. More specifically, evaluation of late blight (Phytophthora infestans) incidence in potato concerning early discrimination of different disease severity levels has not been extensively reported. In this article, the description of spectral changes related to the development of potato late blight under low disease severity levels is performed using sub-decimeter UAV optical imagery. The main objective was to evaluate the sensitivity of the data acquired regarding early changes in crop traits related to disease incidence. For that, UAV images were acquired on four dates during the growing season (from 37 to 78 days after planting), before and after late blight was detected in the field. The spectral variability observed in each date was summarized using Simplex Volume Maximization (SiVM), and its relationship with experimental treatments (different crop systems) and disease severity levels (evaluated by visual assessment) was determined based on pixel-wise log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation. Using this analytical framework it was possible to identify considerable spectral changes related to late blight incidence in different treatments and also to disease severity level as low as between 2.5 and 5.0\% of affected leaf area. Comparison of disease incidence and spectral information acquired using UAV (with 4\&ndash;5 cm of spatial resolution) and ground-based imagery (with 0.1\&ndash;0.2 cm of spatial resolution) indicate that UAV data allowed identification of patterns comparable to those described by ground-based images, despite some differences concerning the distribution of affected areas detected within the sampling units and an attenuation in the signal measured. Finally, although aggregated information at sampling unit level provided discriminative potential for higher levels of disease development, focusing on spectral information related to disease occurrence increased the discriminative potential of the data acquired.},

  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 {$\mu$}m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 {$\mu$}m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as ({$\varrho$}(0.86 {$\mu$}m) - {$\varrho$}(1.24 {$\mu$}m))({$\varrho$}(0.86 {$\mu$}m) + {$\varrho$}(1.24 {$\mu$}m)), where {$\varrho$} represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-{$\mu$}m and the 1.24-{$\mu$}m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 {$\mu$}m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 {$\mu$}m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86\textendash 1.24 {$\mu$}m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-{$\mu$}m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 {$\mu$}m, NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

  abstract = {This study explores the potential of a novel hyperspectral snapshot mosaic camera for weed and maize classification. The image processing, feature engineering and machine learning techniques were discussed when developing an optimal classification model for the three kinds of weeds and maize. A total set of 185 spectral features including reflectance and vegetation index features was constructed. Subsequently, the principal component analysis was used to reduce the redundancy of the constructed features, and the first 5 principal components, explaining over 95\% variance ratio, were kept for further analysis. Furthermore, random forests as one of machine learning techniques were built for developing the classifier with three different combinations of features. Accuracy-oriented feature reduction was performed when choosing the optimal number of features for building the classification model. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning was explored for the optimal selection of random forest model. The results showed that the optimal random forest model with 30 important spectral features can achieve a mean correct classification rate of 1.0, 0.789, 0.691 and 0.752 for Zea mays, Convolvulus arvensis, Rumex and Cirsium arvense, respectively. The McNemar test showed an overall better performance of the optimal random forest model at the 0.05 significance level compared to the k-nearest neighbours (KNN) model.},

  abstract = {Spectral imaging can reveal a lot of hidden details about the world around us, but is currently confined to laboratory environments due to the need for complex, costly and bulky cameras. Imec has developed a unique spectral sensor concept in which the spectral unit is monolithically integrated on top of a standard CMOS image sensor at wafer level, hence enabling the design of compact, low cost and high acquisition speed spectral cameras with a high design flexibility. This flexibility has previously been demonstrated by imec in the form of three spectral camera architectures: firstly a high spatial and spectral resolution scanning camera, secondly a multichannel snapshot multispectral camera and thirdly a per-pixel mosaic snapshot spectral camera. These snapshot spectral cameras sense an entire multispectral data cube at one discrete point in time, extending the domain of spectral imaging towards dynamic, video-rate applications. This paper describes the integration of our per-pixel mosaic snapshot spectral sensors inside a tiny, portable and extremely user-friendly camera. Our prototype demonstrator cameras can acquire multispectral image cubes, either of 272x512 pixels over 16 bands in the VIS (470-620nm) or of 217x409 pixels over 25 bands in the VNIR (600-900nm) at 170 cubes per second for normal machine vision illumination levels. The cameras themselves are extremely compact based on Ximea xiQ cameras, measuring only 26x26x30mm, and can be operated from a laptop-based USB3 connection, making them easily deployable in very diverse environments.},

  abstract = {The reflectance spectra of adaxial surfaces of Aesculus hippocastanum L. and Acer platanoides L. leaves in the course of autumn pigment transformation were recorded. A dramatic decrease in and almost complete disappearance of chlorophyll (Chl) gave an opportunity for the investigation of relations between the reflectance changes and the pigment concentrations. The signature analysis of reflectance spectra indicated that in the green to yellow leaves of both species the maximal standard deviation of reflectance coincided with the red absorption maximum of Chla. However, within the leaves with high Chl, minimal sensitivity to pigment variations was observed at 675 nm. The maximal standard deviations were found near 550 to 560 and 700 to 710 nm. The revealed spectral features can serve as sensitive indicators of early stages of leaf senescence. The several functions of reflectance were found to be directly proportional to Chl (a square of correlation coefficient of more than 0.97); that allows an assessment of the pigment concentration ranging from 0.5 to 27.5 nmol/cm2 with an estimation error of less than 1.5 nmol/cm2. This makes its possible to precisely determine Chla with a background of variable and high pigment concentration.},

Unlike traditional measurements of transpiration that are generally time-consuming, expensive, and often unfeasible, remote sensing techniques such as hyperspectral indices are widely utilized as the only approach to obtain such information on a large scale. However, compared with other biochemical and biophysical parameters, few studies on hyperspectral indices have been applied to estimate canopy transpiration. In this study, we focused on a native dominant plant in the arid land of central Asia, Haloxylon ammodendron, to explore the featured spectra and to develop proper hyperspectral indices for estimating transpiration. This was based on a simultaneous dataset of original canopy-reflectance spectra as well as its first derivatives with transpiration estimated from sap flow. The results indicated that the derivative spectra-based indices are more effective for tracing canopy transpiration compared with its counterpart that was based on the original reflectance. The identified best index for estimating canopy transpiration was dSR(660,1040) based on the first-derivative spectra, which had a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.54. The index is also relatively stable concerning spectral resolutions. Results obtained in this study should help lay the basis for using remote sensing data to estimate transpiration.},

Crop plants protect themselves from excess sunlight by dissipating some light energy as heat, readjusting their systems when shadier conditions prevail. But the photosynthetic systems do not adapt to fluctuating light conditions as rapidly as a cloud passes overhead, resulting in suboptimal photosynthetic efficiency. Kromdijk et al. sped up the adaptation process by accelerating interconversion of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in the xanthophyll cycle and by increasing amounts of a photosystem II subunit. Tobacco plants tested with this system showed about 15\% greater plant biomass production in natural field conditions.
Science, this issue p. 857
Crop leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. When sunlit leaves are shaded by clouds or other leaves, this protective dissipation continues for many minutes and reduces photosynthesis. Calculations have shown that this could cost field crops up to 20\% of their potential yield. Here, we describe the bioengineering of an accelerated response to natural shading events in Nicotiana (tobacco), resulting in increased leaf carbon dioxide uptake and plant dry matter productivity by about 15\% in fluctuating light. Because the photoprotective mechanism that has been altered is common to all flowering plants and crops, the findings provide proof of concept for a route to obtaining a sustainable increase in productivity for food crops and a much-needed yield jump.
Altering the regulation of light harvesting increases photosynthetic efficiency and biomass productivity in crop plants.

The balance between these two processes depends on stomatal responses to environmental and internal cues and the synchrony of stomatal behavior relative to mesophyll demands for CO2. Here we examine the rapidity of stomatal responses with attention to their relationship to photosynthetic CO2 uptake and the consequences for water use. We discuss the influence of anatomical characteristics on the velocity of changes in stomatal conductance and explore the potential for manipulating the physical as well as physiological characteristics of stomatal guard cells in order to accelerate stomatal movements in synchrony with mesophyll CO2 demand and to improve water use efficiency without substantial cost to photosynthetic carbon fixation. We conclude that manipulating guard cell transport and metabolism is just as, if not more likely to yield useful benefits as manipulations of their physical and anatomical characteristics. Achieving these benefits should be greatly facilitated by quantitative systems analysis that connects directly the molecular properties of the guard cells to their function in the field.},

Yet, even at a precision of one cycle in ten millions, clocks may drift significantly in a single second at a clock frequency of several GHz. When tracing the low-level system events in computer clusters, such as packet sending or reception, each computer system records its own events using an internal clock. In order to properly understand the global system behavior and performance, as reported by the events recorded on each computer, it is important to estimate precisely the clock differences and drift between the different computers in the system. This article studies the clock precision and stability of several computer systems, with different architectures. It also studies the typical network delay characteristics, since time synchronization algorithms rely on the exchange of network packets and are dependent on the symmetry of the delays. A very precise clock, based on the atomic time provided by the GPS satellite network, was used as a reference to measure clock drifts and network delays. The results obtained are of immediate use to all applications which depend on computer clocks or network time synchronization accuracy.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of micro- and macro-scale climatic processes. In agriculture, estimates of ET are frequently used to monitor droughts, schedule irrigation, and assess crop water productivity over large areas. Currently, in situ measurements of ET are difficult to scale up for regional applications, so remote sensing technology has been increasingly used to estimate crop ET. Ratio-based vegetation indices retrieved from optical remote sensing, like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, and Enhanced Vegetation Index are critical components of these models, particularly for the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation. These indices have their limitations, however, and can induce large model bias and error. In this study, micrometeorological and spectroradiometric data collected over two growing seasons in cotton, maize, and rice fields in the Central Valley of California were used to identify spectral wavelengths from 428 to 2295nm that produced the highest correlation to and lowest error with ET, transpiration, and soil evaporation. The analysis was performed with hyperspectral narrowbands (HNBs) at 10nm intervals and multispectral broadbands (MSBBs) commonly retrieved by Earth observation platforms. The study revealed that (1) HNB indices consistently explained more variability in ET ({$\Delta$}R2=0.12), transpiration ({$\Delta$}R2=0.17), and soil evaporation ({$\Delta$}R2=0.14) than MSBB indices; (2) the relationship between transpiration using the ratio-based index most commonly used for ET modeling, NDVI, was strong (R2=0.51), but the hyperspectral equivalent was superior (R2=0.68); and (3) soil evaporation was not estimated well using ratio-based indices from the literature (highest R2=0.37), but could be after further evaluation, using ratio-based indices centered on 743 and 953nm (R2=0.72) or 428 and 1518nm (R2=0.69).},

  abstract = {Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that gs (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the gs response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in A and gs over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25\% of the total diurnal gs. This gs response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of gs in a dynamic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of gs to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.},

  abstract = {Both photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) respond to changing irradiance, yet stomatal responses are an order of magnitude slower than photosynthesis, resulting in noncoordination between A and gs in dynamic light environments. Infrared gas exchange analysis was used to examine the temporal responses and coordination of A and gs to a step increase and decrease in light in a range of different species, and the impact on intrinsic water use efficiency was evaluated. The temporal responses revealed a large range of strategies to save water or maximize photosynthesis in the different species used in this study but also displayed an uncoupling of A and gs in most of the species. The shape of the guard cells influenced the rapidity of response and the overall gs values achieved, with different impacts on A and Wi. The rapidity of gs in dumbbell-shaped guard cells could be attributed to size, whilst in elliptical-shaped guard cells features other than anatomy were more important for kinetics. Our findings suggest significant variation in the rapidity of stomatal responses amongst species, providing a novel target for improving photosynthesis and water use.},

However, the impact of genomics data on crop improvement is still far from satisfactory, in large part due to a lack of effective phenotypic data; our capacity to collect useful high quality phenotypic data lags behind the current capacity to generate high-throughput genomics data. Thus, the research bottleneck in plant sciences is shifting from genotyping to phenotyping. This article review the current status of efforts made in the last decade to systematically collect phenotypic data to alleviate this `phenomics bottlenecks' by recording trait data through sophisticated non-invasive imaging, spectroscopy, image analysis, robotics, high-performance computing facilities and phenomics databases. These modern phenomics platforms and tools aim to record data on traits like plant development, architecture, plant photosynthesis, growth or biomass productivity, on hundreds to thousands of plants in a single day, as a phenomics revolution. It is believed that this revolution will provide plant scientists with the knowledge and tools necessary for unlocking information coded in plant genomes. Efforts have been also made to present the advances made in the last 10 years in phenomics platforms and their use in generating phenotypic data on different traits in several major crops including rice, wheat, barley, and maize. The article also highlights the need for phenomics databases and phenotypic data sharing for crop improvement. The phenomics data generated has been used to identify genes/QTL through QTL mapping, association mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for genomics-assisted breeding (GAB) for crop improvement.},

Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) being an integration of two modalities, imaging and point spectroscopy, is nowadays emerging as a potential tool for rapid, non-destructive and automated close range assessment of plants functional dynamics both in terms of structure and physiology. Firstly, this paper presents an overview of some basic concepts of close range HSI on plants, concerning the plant\textendash light interaction, instrumental setup, and spectral data analysis. Furthermore, the work reviews recent advances of HSI for plant related studies under controlled experimental conditions as well as in natural agricultural settings. Applications are discussed on foliar content estimation, variety identification, growth monitoring, stress and disease-related studies, phenotyping and adoption of HSI in high-throughput phenotyping platforms (HTPPs). Close range HSI is a challenging task and suffers from technical complexities related to external factors (e.g. illumination effects) as well as plant-related factors (e.g. complex plant geometry). The paper finally discusses some of the technical challenges related to the implementation of HSI in the close range assessment of plant traits.},

Molecular components of chloroplast photoprotection are closely aligned with those of photosynthesis and together they influence productivity. Proof of principle now exists that major photoprotective processes such as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) directly determine whole canopy photosynthesis, biomass and yield via prevention of photoinhibition and a momentary downregulation of photosynthetic quantum yield. However, this phenomenon has neither been quantified nor well characterized across different environments. Here we address this problem by assessing the existing literature with a different approach to that taken previously, beginning with our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NPQ and its regulation within dynamic environments. We then move to the leaf and the plant level, building an understanding of the circumstances (when and where) NPQ limits photosynthesis and linking to our understanding of how this might take place on a molecular and metabolic level. We argue that such approaches are needed to fine tune the relevant features necessary for improving dynamic NPQ in important crop species.},

A hyperspectral camera of 369\textendash 1042nm was employed to acquire hyperspectral images of green fruits of three different citrus varieties (Tangelo, Valencia, and Hamlin). First, a pixel discrimination function was generated based upon a linear discriminant analysis and applied to all pixels in a hyperspectral image for image segmentation of fruit and other objects. Then, spatial image processing steps (noise reduction filtering, labeling, and area thresholding) were applied to the segmented image, and green citrus fruits were detected. The results of pixel identification tests showed that detection success rates were 70\textendash 85\%, depending on citrus varieties. The fruit detection tests revealed that 80\textendash 89\% of the fruit in the foreground of the validation set were identified correctly, though many occluded or highly contrasted fruits were identified incorrectly.},

Since visible (VIS)-to-shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging spectrometers are able to monitor various bio-chemical alterations in the leaf, such narrow-band instruments may offer a faster, less expensive and non-destructive alternative. This requires an intelligent downsizing of broad and noisy hyperspectra into the few most physiologically-sensitive wavelengths. In the current study, hyperspectral signatures of water-stressed grapevine leaves (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) were correlated to values of midday leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}l), stomatal conductance (gs) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under controlled conditions, using the partial least squares-regression (PLS-R) technique. It was found that opposite reflectance trends at 530\textendash 550nm and around 1500nm \textendash{} associated with independent changes in photoprotective pigment contents and water availability, respectively \textendash{} were indicative of stress-induced alterations in {$\Psi$}l, gs and NPQ. Furthermore, combining the spectral responses at these VIS and SWIR regions yielded three normalized water balance indices (WABIs), which were superior to various widely-used reflectance models in predicting physiological values at both the leaf and canopy levels. The potential of the novel WABI formulations also under field conditions demonstrates their applicability for water status monitoring and irrigation scheduling.},

This dynamic behaviour is of paramount importance for their performance under natural conditions, when resources are distributed heterogeneously in space and time. However, plants are not only the cue ball of their physical and chemical environment. Endogenous rhythms and networks controlling photosynthesis and growth buffer plant processes from external fluctuations. This review highlights recent evidence of the importance of dynamic temporal and spatial organization of photosynthesis and of growth in leaves and roots. These central processes for plant performance differ strongly in their dependence on environmental impact and endogenous properties, respectively. Growth involves a wealth of processes ranging from the supply of resources from external and internal sources to the growth processes themselves. In contrast, photosynthesis can only take place when light and CO2 are present and thus clearly requires `input from the environment'. Nevertheless, growth and photosynthesis are connected to each other via mechanisms that are still not fully understood. Recent advances in imaging technology have provided new insights into the dynamics of plant\textendash environment interactions. Such processes do not only play a crucial role in understanding stress response of plants under extreme environmental conditions. Dynamics of plants under modest growth conditions rise from endogenous mechanisms as well as exogenous impact too. It is thus an important task for future research to identify how dynamic external conditions interact with plant-internal signalling networks to optimize plant behaviour in real time and to understand how plants have adapted to characteristic spatial and temporal properties of the resources from their environment, on which they depend on.},

  abstract = {Rapid photosynthetic induction is crucial for plants under fluctuating light conditions in a crop canopy as well as in an understory. Most previous studies have focused on photosynthetic induction responses in a single leaf, whereas the systemic responses of the whole plant have not been considered. In a natural environment, however, both single leaves and whole plants are exposed to sunlight, since the light environment is not uniform even within a given plant. In the present study, we examined whether there is any difference between the photosynthetic induction response of a leaf of a whole irradiated plant (WIP) and an individually irradiated leaf (IIL) in Arabidopsis thaliana to consider photosynthetic induction as the response of a whole plant. We used two methods, the visualization of photosynthesis and direct measurements of gas-exchange and Chl fluorescence, to demonstrate that WIP promoted its photosynthetic induction via improved stomatal opening compared with IIL. Furthermore, using two Arabidopsis knockout mutants of ABA transporter, abcg25 and abcg40, the present study suggests that ABA could be involved in this systemic response for stomatal opening, allowing plants to optimize the use of light energy at minimal cost in plants in a dynamic light environment.},

  abstract = {Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term changes in the light environment. The three-dimensional architecture of plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimation in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted to predict the optimal distribution of photosynthesis according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This suboptimal acclimation renders a large portion of residual photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implications for photosynthetic productivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.},

  abstract = {Automatic detection of early blight caused by Alternaria solani could promote a drastic reduction in the consumption of plant protection agents and the related production losses. A proximal sensing platform was constructed and calibrated for acquiring high resolution hyperspectral images in the field, and used to accurately map Alternaria lesions. High resolution canopy reflectance images were obtained for 32 potato plants that had been infected with A. solani and 32 healthy reference plants. Spectral classifiers like partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machines (SVM) based on PCA scores were tested to discriminate affected and non-affected pixels. Both spectral classifiers performed well at pixel level with accuracies above 0.92. The NIR region (750~nm) was identified as the most discriminative part of the spectrum for detecting the lesions. As the disease pressure is typically expressed as the number of lesions per area, the accuracy was also evaluated at this level. This indicated a considerable number of false detections at the edges of the leaves and the leaf axils. Therefore, a decision tree was designed based on expert knowledge about the shape of Alternaria lesions, and used to post-process the classified images. This reduced the number of false detections, increasing the precision from 0.17 to 0.22 at the expense of a reduction in recall from 0.88 to 0.84. This leaves considerable room for improvement in the classification accuracy at the object level. We learned that (1) few, broad wavelengths are sufficient and (2) spatial context is essential for the detection of lesions caused by Alternaria infection. The application of more powerful object classification techniques such as convolutional neural networks to enhance the model performance by efficiently encapsulating the spatial context in the classifier might further improve the detection performance. This could pave the way to UAV or tractor based Alternaria mapping.},

  abstract = {The acclimation of plants to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on plant phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square wave pattern, were used to grow and assess plants. Plants subjected to square wave light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown plants. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, plants grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square wave-grown plants. Despite high light use efficiency, plants grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that plants grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20\%. These findings highlight that growing plants under square wave growth conditions ultimately fails to predict plant performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer plant productivity under natural conditions in the field.},

Chlorophyll data and high spectral resolution spectrometer laboratory reflectance data were acquired for multiple collections of single detached sugar maple leaves variously affected by the insect over the 1988 growing season. Reflectance data indicated consistent and diagnostic differences in the red edge portion (680-750 nm) of the spectrum among the various samples and populations of leaves. These included differences in the red edge inflection point (REIP), a ratio of reflectance at 740-720 nm (RE3/RE2), and a ratio of first derivative values at 715-705 nm (D715/D705), All three red edge parameters were highly correlated with variation in total chlorophyll content. Other spectral measures, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Simple Vegetation Index Ratio (VI), also varied among populations and over the growing season, but did not correlate well with total chlorophyll content. Leaf stacking studies on light and dark backgrounds indicated REIP, RE3/RE2 and D715/D705 to be much less influenced by differences in green leaf biomass and background condition than either NDVI or VI.},

In this work, we present an approach to plant phenotyping that integrates non-invasive sensors, computer vision, as well as data mining techniques and allows for monitoring how plants respond to stress. To uncover latent hyperspectral characteristics of diseased plants reliably and in an easy-to-understand way, we ``wordify'' the hyperspectral images, i.e., we turn the images into a corpus of text documents. Then, we apply probabilistic topic models, a well-established natural language processing technique that identifies content and topics of documents. Based on recent regularized topic models, we demonstrate that one can track automatically the development of three foliar diseases of barley. We also present a visualization of the topics that provides plant scientists an intuitive tool for hyperspectral imaging. In short, our analysis and visualization of characteristic topics found during symptom development and disease progress reveal the hyperspectral language of plant diseases.},

This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance ({$\lambda$} = 500\textendash 2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (Zea mays). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylation, [CO2]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.},

The present study makes progress in demonstrating the relationship between steady-state fluorescence and net photosynthesis measured under natural light field conditions both at the leaf and image levels. Ground measurements and airborne campaigns were conducted over two summers to acquire hyperspectral imagery at 40cm resolution and 260 spectral bands in the 400\textendash 885nm spectral region. This enabled the identification of pure vegetation pixels to extract their radiance spectra. The datasets were collected in August 2010 and 2011 in the western part of the area included in the Ribera del Duero Designation of Origin (Denominaci\'on de Origen), in northern Spain. The experiments were conducted in twelve full production vineyards where two study plots per field were selected to ensure adequate variability in leaf biochemistry and physiological condition. The vineyard fields were selected on the basis of their gradient in leaf nutrition and plant water status and showed variability in leaf pigment values and stomatal conductance. Leaves were collected for destructive sampling and biochemical determination of chlorophyll a+b, carotenoids and anthocyanins in the laboratory. Leaf steady-state and dark-adapted fluorescence parameters, net photosynthesis (Pn) and stomatal conductance (Gs) were measured in the field under natural light conditions. Such data were used as a validation dataset to assess fluorescence\textendash photosynthesis relationships both at the leaf and the image level. The Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle based on three spectral bands (FLD3) was the method used to quantify fluorescence emission from radiance spectra extracted from pure vegetation pixels identified in the hyperspectral imagery. Fluorescence retrievals conducted using the FLD3 method yielded significant results when compared to ground-measured steady-state Fs (r2=0.48; p{$<$}0.01) and Fv{${'}$}/Fm{${'}$} (r2=0.53; p{$<$}0.01). The two-year assessment yielded consistent results on the relationship between Pn and Fs both at the leaf level and based on the airborne hyperspectral imagery. At the leaf level, significant relationships were found between leaf Fs and Pn (r2=0.55; p{$<$}0.001 for 2010; r2=0.59; p{$<$}0.001 for 2011). At the hyperspectral image level, the agreement between leaf Pn and airborne F was consistent for both years separately, yielding significant relationships at p{$<$}0.01 for 2010 (r2=0.54) and 2011 (r2=0.41) and a significant relationship at p{$<$}0.001 for the aggregated years (r2=0.52).

  abstract = {This study provides insight into the assessment of the spatio-temporal trends of chlorophyll fluorescence, narrow-band physiological indices, and structural indices acquired with a hyperspectral imager flown over a flux tower in a canopy characterized by small seasonal structural changes and a heterogeneous architecture. A total of seven flights between summer and autumn were conducted with a hyperspectral camera that captured 30cm resolution imagery and 260 spectral bands in the 400-900nm region. This enabled the identification of pure-vegetation tree crown pixels around an eddy covariance flux tower without shadow components or background effects. The hyperspectral imagery was used to study the temporal patterns of canopy fluorescence and reflectance indices related to physiology and canopy structure. The seasonal trends observed in the airborne indices and fluorescence and their relationship with gross primary production (GPP) demonstrated that vegetation indices mostly related to structure such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) yielded non-significant relationships (r2=0.17; p{$>$}0.05) due to the small structural changes in the canopy through the season. By contrast, physiological indices related to chlorophyll content (TCARI/OSAVI), light use efficiency (PRI570), and canopy chlorophyll fluorescence calculated through the Fraunhofer Line Depth principle (FLD3) showed a similar seasonal trend to that of GPP measured at the same time of the flights (r2 in the range 0.75\textendash 0.84; p{$<$}0.01). These results are consistent with the physiological trend observed during summer and autumn, which showed that chlorophyll content increased by 17.9\% while the NDVI and the estimated tree crown projected LAI (LAIp) remained almost constant during the experiment (3\% variation). The time-series hyperspectral dataset demonstrated that the seasonal trajectories of the NDVI and EVI were weakly related (p{$>$}0.05) to the physiological indicators such as TCARI/OSAVI, PRI570 and fluorescence. The spatial variability of the hyperspectral indices investigated through the coefficient of variation (CV) showed that fluorescence around the tower varied up to 17\% at the time of the maximum stress (summer), while LAIp showed little variation during that time (CV=1.8\%). After the summer stress period, the CV for fluorescence and chlorophyll content decreased in autumn down to 9\%. This study demonstrates that small physiological changes occurring in an evergreen canopy were still captured by remote sensing physiological indices and high-resolution airborne fluorescence. These indicators are required for GPP monitoring when the vegetation dynamics are not captured by remote sensing structural indices.},

Sorghum (cv. DK 44C) was seeded in 360 twelve-litre pots filled with fine sand. All pots were irrigated with half-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution from emergence to 25 days after sowing (DAS). Thereafter, pots were separated into three identical groups and the following treatments were initiated: (1) the control (100\% N) continued receiving the half-strength nutrient solution; (2) reduced N to 20\% of the control (20\% N); and (3) withheld N from the solution (0\% N). Photosynthetic rate (Pn), chlorophyll (Chl) and N concentrations, and hyperspectral reflectance of the uppermost, fully expanded leaves were determined at 3- to 4-day-interval from 21 to 58 DAS during the N treatments. Plants were harvested 58 DAS to determine effects of N deficiency on leaf area (LA), biomass accumulation, and partitioning. Nitrogen deficiency significantly reduced LA, leaf Chl content and Pn, resulting in lower biomass production. Decreased leaf Pn due to N deficiency was mainly associated with lower stomatal conductance rather than carboxylation capacity of leaf chemistry. Among plant components of dry weights, leaf dry weight had the greatest and root dry weight had the smallest decrease under N deficiency. Nitrogen-deficit stress mainly increased leaf reflectance at 555 (R555) and 715nm (R715) and caused a red-edge shift to shorter wavelength. Leaf N and Chl concentrations were linearly correlated with not only the reflectance ratios of R405/R715 (r2 = 0.68***) and R1075/R735 (r2 = 0.64***), respectively, but also the first derivatives of the reflectance (dR/d{$\lambda$}) in red edge centered 730 or 740nm (r2 = 0.73\textendash 0.82***).

  abstract = {A novel hyperspectral-physiological system that monitors plants dynamic response to abiotic alterations was developed. The system is a sensor-to-plant platform which can determine the optimal time of day during which physiological traits can be successfully identified via spectral means. The directly measured traits include momentary and daily transpiration rates throughout the daytime and daily and periodical plant weight loss and gain. The system monitored and evaluated pepper plants response to varying levels of potassium fertilization. Significant momentary transpiration rates differences were found between the treatments during 07:00\&ndash;10:00 and 14:00\&ndash;17:00. The simultaneous frequently measured high-resolution spectral data provided the means to correlate the two measured data sets. Significant correlation coefficients between the spectra and momentary transpiration rates resulted with a selection of three bands (\&rho;523, \&rho;697 and \&rho;818nm) that were used to capture transpiration rate differences using a normalized difference formula during the morning, noon and the afternoon. These differences also indicated that the best results are not always obtained when spectral (remote or proximal) measurements are typically preformed around noon (when solar illumination is the highest). Valuable information can be obtained when the spectral measurements are timed according to the plants\&rsquo; dynamic physiological status throughout the day, which may vary among plant species and should be considered when planning remote sensing data acquisition.},
